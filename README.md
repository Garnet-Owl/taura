# taura
A project to build machine translation model for translating Kikuyu to English

# Context
the name taura is derived from the Kikuyu word, 'Ta≈©ra', which means 'Translate', which is exactly what we will attempt to do in this project.

We seek to build a machine translation model that will be able to translate text from Kikuyu to English and vice versa with a reasonable minimum tranlation accuracy

Kikuyu is a Bantu language spoken by the Kikuyu people of Kenya. It's the most widely spoken language in Kenya, after English and Swahili.
